Finally getting around to utilising this space here at GitHub. My intention is to document a bit more of my projects as I'm building them. I hope to capture at least some of the ideas and reasons that went into the making of the project, and not just the end-product.

So far, this blog is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) that is used in the tutorial. I would like to make blog posts the long format of what is going on with the projects, and the project page the external at-a-glance status.
