# Accomplishments
## Developed a Network Monitoring Solution
Early in my career, I served as the technical lead in developing a full featured network monitoring
solution that used OpenNMS as the core with several small components and "glue" software that
were custom made. This system replaced an HP OpenView setup on Sun hardware, which greatly
simplified administration of the monitoring system and reduced expenses.

## Configuration Management
Maintained and modified a configuration management system consisting of Cfengine3 and Perl
that used hardware detection and network resources. Developed a custom release system that
could adapt to arbitrary processes, was used to release software in addition to performing cluster
build tasks, and went on to be the base of the automated testing system.

## Cluster Management
Built large clusters of systems containing several services that provided extremely low-latency
data access spread across hundreds of servers in a n+1 distributed environment. Lead discovery
and documenting cluster build process to enable build automation.
